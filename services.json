    "description": "The Swedish massage is one of the most common types of massages you can get. It is performed to energize the body and improve overall health. This type of massage involves actions like percussion, kneading, vibration, tapping and rolling. Massage oil or lotion is used to protect the skin from friction.Massages are a great way to relax and unwind. A massage involves manipulating the muscles and joints to relieve stress or pain. This is achieved by relaxing tight muscles and promoting blood circulation.Getting a Swedish massage can also be beneficial to your heart. A masseuse (a person that practices massage) manipulates the body's soft tissues (muscles, tendons, ligaments and blood vessels) and uses strokes that flow toward the heart, improving blood circulation.Swedish massage may help reduce symptoms of depression, stress, and anxiety. Some of the symptoms that could be managed by massage therapy include back pains, headaches, muscle issues and other chronic pains.Massages are also associated with boosting immunity. This can help you in managing conditions like the common cold, asthma, diabetes, and breast cancer."

    "description": "Some people may turn to a hot stone massage as a way of relaxing after a stressful or tense time.A massage therapist uses different techniques to relax the long, skeletal muscles of the body. There are many movements that the therapist can use, such as long strokes, circular motions, tapping, and kneading.In this article we look at a type of massage called a hot stone massage. We see how hot stone massage therapy is carried out, and what the possible benefits and risks are.During a hot stone massage, the techniques of a regular massage are applied. However, the therapist also works with hot stones that are placed on specific parts of the body.The stones are smooth and flat and usually made of the volcanic rock type called basalt. These particular stones are chosen because they retain heat.Some massage therapists hold the stones in their hands and use them to massage with. This allows the therapist to get deeper into the muscles without more pressure, helping their client to relax yet further.Occasionally, cold stones can be used on the face or after the hot stones have been applied. Cold temperature helps to calm swollen blood vessels and soothe hot skin.This type of hot stone therapeutic treatment is thought to have originated in China almost 2,000 years ago. Since then, the technique of using stones for healing has been used in many different cultures, including the Americas, Africa, Egypt, and India.To get the best out of a hot stone massage, it is important for people to be open with their massage therapist.The massage therapist should be aware of any health conditions a client has that could affect how they perform the massage."

    "description": "The form of massage therapy is used for everything from immune support to anxiety relief.Acupressure is a thousands-year-old form of massage therapy that involves applying pressure to certain points on the body to address ailments. According to traditional Chinese medicine, people have meridians or channels throughout the body. Qi, which is understood as a life-sustaining energy force, runs along those meridians. Qi can become stuck at some points along the meridians, and the goal of acupressure is to keep the energy flowing using pressure at specific points. Western medicine doesn't include the existence of the meridians, so acupressure isn't part of mainstream medical treatment here.There are hundreds of acupressure points on the body, corresponding to other parts of the body. (For example, there's a point on your hand for your kidney.) So, naturally, the practice has many associated benefits. As with any form of massage, a huge perk of acupressure is relaxation, one that you can get behind even if you doubt the existence of meridians. Acupressure is often used for pain relief, and studies have suggested it may help fight back pain, menstrual cramps, and headaches. The practice is used for many other purposes that have been studied less, including immune system and digestion support."

    "description": "Sports massage is manual manipulation of the muscles geared specifically toward helping people who have physically demanding lifestyles and/or hobbies. This kind of therapeutic massage considers the impact of certain activities on specific joints, muscle groups, tendons, ligaments, and soft tissue groups. The conscious focus of sports massage therapy maximizes the benefit of certain massage techniques and supports further physical exertion and activity. An initial assessment is used to create a specially informed massage therapy plan that will meet each individual athlete's specific needs.Why would someone choose this kind of athletic therapy when there are so many other kinds of massages available? Activities such as athletic games, official sports, and intense exercise can be hard on the body. This means choosing the right kind of massage method for an active lifestyle and body. The purpose of a deep tissue massage, for example, is to treat chronic pain and on-going tension. This might be beneficial in a very general sense, but sports massage therapy is specifically designed to support and enhance the performance, recovery, and relaxation of people (typically athletes) who are frequently and/or intensely physically active.thletic massages are obviously a benefit to people who play professional sports, but these athletes are not the only people who can benefit from sports massage therapy. The emphasis on athletics comes from the high rate of physical strain and damage caused by long term participation in sport activities, as well as the training that often goes with them. However, there are plenty of activities that can have an equal or greater toll on the body's physical well-being. Let's take a look at some of the many groups of people who could benefit from a sports massage."

    "description": "Prenatal massage is a type that's similar to regular massage - it aims to relax tense muscles, ease sore spots, improve circulation and mobility, and just make you feel good. But prenatal massage is also customized to the needs of pregnant women and their changing bodies, and therapists trained in prenatal massage adjust their techniques accordingly.Carrying a baby inside you changes your center of gravity and puts a lot of stress on your back, neck, abdominal muscles, and shoulders. Pregnancy also relaxes your ligaments, meaning your pelvic joints are less stable, and it also changes your posture, pulling your pelvis forward. Add to that the extra weight you're carrying and you may end up with an aching lower back.A trained prenatal massage therapist knows where a pregnant woman's sore and swollen spots are likely to be and may be able to provide some relief. They'll also know which techniques and areas to avoid.etting a pregnancy massage can also put you in a more relaxed state of mind to help you cope with all the big changes that are going on in your life.If you decide to get a massage, it's important to tell your massage therapist that you're pregnant. And let them know right away if anything - including your position - causes discomfort during the massage.To find a good prenatal massage therapist, get recommendations from your hospital, healthcare provider, or friends. If you already have a favorite massage therapist, ask whether they have training in prenatal massage or can recommend a colleague who does.Some massage therapists want clearance from your doctor or midwife before treating you, so ask about that ahead of time. When you meet your therapist, remind them that you're pregnant before you begin your session."

    "description": "Thai massage uses gentle pressure and stretching techniques to relax the whole body. This is an ancient healing practice that originated in India. It dates back to around 2,500-7,000 years ago.The technique that Thai massage practitioners use is very different from what people in the West may be accustomed to. Unlike Swedish or shiatsu massage techniques, in which a person passively lies on a bed, the client lies on the floor and participates more actively in the massage.This article will look at the benefits of Thai massage, how it can help athletes, and some of the side effects that people may experience.Thai massage has many health benefits, from lowering stress to relieving muscular tension.The Thai massage technique is based on the notion of energy lines, or Sen. Most practitioners believe that there are various Sen, or channels, of energy within the body.Stress is not necessarily bad. Often, stress can act as a positive motivator that might help push people to perform better and accomplish more in their personal and professional lives.However, too much stress can negatively affect mental and physical health. Chronic, or long-lasting, stress can lead to serious illnesses, including depression and cardiovascular disease.Thai massage uses gentle pressure and stretching techniques to relax the body. A 2015 studyTrusted Source found that Thai massage significantly reduces levels of a certain stress marker present in the saliva, called sAA."

    "description": "Deep tissue massage is a massage technique that's mainly used to treat musculoskeletal issues, such as strains and sports injuries. It involves applying sustained pressure using slow, deep strokes to target the inner layers of your muscles and connective tissues. This helps to break up scar tissue that forms following an injury and reduce tension in muscle and tissue.It may also promote faster healing by increasing blood flow and reducing inflammation.Read on to learn more about deep tissue massage, including how it stacks up against Swedish massage and what to expect during a session.Deep tissue massage offers both physical and psychological benefits. Unlike other massage techniques that focus on relaxation, deep tissue massage helps to treat muscle pain and improve stiffness. But it can still help to you unwind mentally, too.A 2014 study involving 59 participants found that deep tissue massage helped to reduce pain in people with chronic low back. The authors likened its effects to those of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen (Advil).Deep tissue massage and Swedish massage are two different types of massage therapy. Both use some of the same strokes, but they have different uses and vary greatly when it comes to the amount of pressure used.Before your deep tissue massage, your massage therapist will want to know about your problem areas. A deep tissue massage can involve your entire body or just one area.Once ready, you'll be asked to lie on your back or stomach, under a sheet. Your level of undress is based on your comfort, but the area being worked on will need to be exposed.The massage therapist will warm up your muscles using a lighter touch. Once you're warmed up, they'll start working on your problem areas. They'll use deep kneading and stroking with varying amounts of intense pressure."

    "description": "An aromatherapy massage is a popular multi-purpose way of using supplemental care for health issues. The skin absorbs essential oils maintaining suppleness, it offers pain relief, and the aroma's mental stimulation provides clients with the ultimate massage session.As well as being great for soothing sore muscles along with any other aches and pains, aromatherapy massage can help to ease the symptoms of many medical conditions.When combined with relaxing essential oils such as lavender or bergamot, aromatherapy massage can be beneficial for conditions such as anxiety, depression and insomnia. As your sense of smell and your emotions are so closely linked, aromatherapy is able to tap into your emotions, directly impacting your mental wellbeing and promoting restorative sleep.Studies have also shown that aromatherapy massage can be beneficial for patients being treated for cancer. When cancer patients were treated with two aromatherapy massages per week, their levels of stress and anxiety were reduced whilst the function of their immune system improved.Aromatherapy massage has also been proven to reduce menstrual cramping. A 2015 study found that the severity of pain reported was significantly lower in women who massaged themselves with rose oil on the first day of their cycle. Almost any type of massage can be combined with aromatherapy, with different types of massage suited to different conditions. Some of the most well-known types of massage used alongside essential oils are Swedish massage, deep tissue massage and hot stone massage. The essential oils may be mixed with a carrier oil and used as part of the massage, or they might be added to a diffuser for inhalation during the massage."

    "description": "Shiatsu is a bodywork that originated in Japan. It integrates Japan's traditional manual therapies such as acupuncture and anma, an old Japanese massage style, with western medical knowledge. Healthcare professionals view shiatsu as a modified form of acupressure, a massage therapy that involves pressing specific points in the body to reduce tension and fatigue by improving blood and lymphatic circulation. Shiatsu has its roots in the concept of qi. In traditional Chinese medicine, qi is the vital life force that drives all life activity. It believes that health occurs when qi flows unobstructed. When it becomes deficient or blocked, symptoms such as body pain, headaches, and digestive issues ariseA shiatsu therapist applies pressure on the body's meridians, parts of the body believed to be energy channels, to balance or unblock the flow of energy (qi). While shiatsu translates as finger pressure, a shiatsu therapist may also use palms, elbows, and sometimes feet to apply pressure along energy lines or paths to relieve pain and tension in the body. Before the session begins, a shiatsu practitioner evaluates the person and assesses a person's state of qi to plan the session. The practitioner may perform varying protocols based on the person's general energy level, presence of blockages, and conditions. For example, when a person has deficient energy levels, the practitioner uses techniques to reactivate or stimulate the blood and qi circulation. Meanwhile, they may utilize techniques to diffuse excess energy in anxious and stressed individuals. Practitioners perform manual techniques such as holding, stretching, tapping, pressure, kneading, and soothing, using their thumbs, fingers, palms, and knees. They may also do more body stretches, rotations, and joint mobilizations. From time to time, the therapist may ask the person to change their position to allow them to work on specific meridian points to energy stagnation or blockages. Shiatsu does not use instruments or oils. During a session, individuals are fully clothed and traditionally lie on a futon mat placed on a floor, but lying on a massage table is also common."

    "description": "Reflexology is the application of pressure to areas on the feet (or the hands). Reflexology is generally relaxing and may help alleviate stress. The theory behind reflexology is that areas of the foot correspond to organs and systems of the body. Pressure applied to the foot is believed to bring relaxation and healing to the corresponding area of the body.Reflexologists use foot charts to guide them as they apply pressure to specific areas. Reflexology is sometimes combined with other hands-on therapies and may be offered by chiropractors and physical therapists, among others. Several studies indicate that reflexology may reduce pain and psychological symptoms, such as stress and anxiety, and enhance relaxation and sleep. Given that reflexology is also low risk, it can be a reasonable option if you're seeking relaxation and stress relief. Reflexology rests on the ancient Chinese belief in qi (pronounced “chee”), or “vital energy.” According to this belief, qi flows through each person. When a person feels stressed, their body blocks qi. This can cause an imbalance in the body that leads to illness. Reflexology aims to keep qi flowing through the body, keeping it balanced and disease free. In Chinese medicine, different body parts correspond with different pressure points on the body. Reflexologists use maps of these points in the feet, hands, and ears to determine where they should apply pressure. They believe their touch sends energy flowing through a person’s body until it reaches the area in need of healing."
